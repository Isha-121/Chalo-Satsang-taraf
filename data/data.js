This being summer season round balls of sandalwood paste are prepared and applied on different parts of Thakorji’s body.Akshay Trutiya is the patotsav of Shrinathji i.e. the day when His Pranpratishtha (establishment) was performed. However, on that day Shrinathji went to devalaya from the house. Hence we do not celebrate this as a patotsav.`,
