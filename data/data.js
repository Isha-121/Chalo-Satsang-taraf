But at times it breaks those limitations and executes pushti (grace). As for eg. he ate ber fruit already tasted by his devotee Shabri. He killed Bali as parthi. Krshnaavtaar is known as Pushti Purshottam. Sthaayi bhaav is pushti but he at times accepts maryada under sanchaari bhaav. Rama wept for his father Dashrath. He wept for Sitaji. While Krshna is never quoted crying for any gopi or anybody. With all these, Thakorjis left foot is Pushti (love), dominated and right foot is maryada (mahatmyagnyaan – dominated) His eyes, ears etc appear likewise. Pushtibhakti is love, alongwith mahaatmyagnyaan. Rama + Krshna. But being love dominated Pushti Bhakti is always stuffed of Vrajleela.`
